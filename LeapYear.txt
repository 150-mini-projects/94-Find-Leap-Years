What Is a Leap Year? 

The Short Answer: It takes approximately 365.25 days for Earth to orbit the Sun â€” a solar year.
 We usually round the days in a calendar year to 365. 
 
 To make up for the missing partial day, we add one day to our calendar approximately 
 every four years. That is a leap year.
